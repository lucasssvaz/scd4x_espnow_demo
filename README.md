# SCD4x ESP-NOW demo

This is a demo that uses the ESP32-S3-LCD-EV-Board v1.5 with a Lapa Sensor Board that contains the SCD40 sensor to read CO2, temperature and humidity for transmitting this data using the ESP-NOW protocol and a ESP32-S3-USB-OTG with the ST7789 display for receiving and displaying the data.

## Software Requirements

- SparkFun SCD4x Arduino Library
- Adafruit ST7789 Library
- Adafruit GFX Library
- Arduino Core for ESP32 >= 3.0.0
